      <p>How to choose your flight school</p>
    </div>
       
      <div class="textmiddlebox">
      <p>Learning to fly can be one of life's most rewarding adventures. The freedom of moving in three dimensions is not only fun but can lead to interesting career and travel opportunities. To take advantage of aviation's rewards, you must make sure you get the good, solid information and aviation training that you'll need to be a safe, confident pilot in the air. One of the most important steps in that process is finding the right flight school.

AOPA Flight Training magazine has prepared the following general guidance information. It is intended as an aid for anyone interested in learning to fly and for selecting the aviation training organization that will meet the individual's specific needs.

Without any aviation experience on which to base your decision, selecting a good flight school can be a formidable task. Aviation is procedural and not well suited to impatience. Whether you're flying an airplane or picking a school, making rash, hurried decisions can have negative consequences. Checklists are an aviation mainstay that ensure all procedures are accomplished and, therefore, make for safe flights. This same procedure can be applied to selecting a good flight school.

<b>Learning to Flyâ€”How to Determine What Aviation Training You Need and Want</b>

At the beginning of your flight school search, it helps if you have a general idea of what you want from aviation. Why do you want to learn to fly? What is your ultimate, long-term aviation goal? Do you want to fly for fun, or are you seeking a flying career? Will your flying be local, or do you want to use general aviation aircraft to travel? Do you want to own an airplane or will you rent? These are questions you should answer before you start considering flight schools. And you should consider whether you'll train full time or part time; that can make a big difference in your flight school selection criteria. <br><br><b>To ontinue reading article, go to the topic at:</b>
